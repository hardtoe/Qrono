Qrono Minecraft Mod
===================

Qrono is a tech mod that provides a unique spin on minecraft automation with efficient server utilization.  The name Qrono is a [Portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of Quantum and Chrono.  The gameplay mechanics of Qrono are designed to allow for efficient server utilization with automation under the guise of [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) and the mystical properties of Chronoton Ore and all things Ender.

Gameplay Concepts
-----------------
The core concept introduced by Qrono is automated power, liquid, and item processing in a **Quantum Network**.  A Quantum Network is a collection of **Quantum Processing Machine** blocks connected with eachother via **Waveguide** pipes or conduit.  

Through the power of Chronoton Ore and Ender Pearls a well designed Quantum network is able to continue processing indefinately once it has been started.  The Quantum Network operation is not bound by the physical rules of the Minecraft universe.  From a real-world perspective this means the network will continue to function when it is not chunkloaded or even if the server is shutdown.  Time will continue to pass for the Quantum Network and it will continue to function the same whether it is loaded or not.  Details of this capability are described later in this document.

### Automation

Quantum Networks provide machines for performing automation users of existing tech mods will find familiar (mods like EnderIO, IndustrialCraft2, Extra Utilities, and Thermal Expansion).  As such Quantum Networks can be built to perform many common automation tasks in modded minecraft.  For example:
* Quarry and refine ores into usable resources
* Large autocrafting jobs
* Power generation

Enormous automated systems generating large amounts of resources and consuming and processing those resources can be created using Qrono.  These automated systems then have the potential to run offline if they are designed well.

### Managing Heat and Entropy

Quantum Networks are a powerful tool for automation but there are some interesting quirks that need to be handled to unlock this incredible power.  For Quantum Networks to function they need to maintain Quantum Coherence between all of the machines in the network.  In order to become coherent the machine temperatures need to be cooled down to superconducting levels.  This requires specialized machines for cooling down coolant to be pumped through the machines.  Large Quantum Networks require sophisticated cooling infrastructure to bring them to the target temperature needed for coherence. 

Once a Quantum Network is running it needs to manage its entropy generation.  If not disposed of properly entropy will cause the Quantum Network to lose coherence, stop running, and all entropy in the network is converted to heat which will need to be dissipated before the network can be started up again.  Note that cooling down the network and starting it up again requires classical machines; if these classical machines are not chunkloaded when the network goes down they will not be able to bring it back up again.

### Interfacing with Other Machines

Quantum Networks require specialized machines to transfer items, liquids, or power with non-quantum or classical machines.  This is because things are processed within the network in "wave-form", while things processed by classical machines are in their "particle-form". Non-quantum machine blocks like those found in mods like EnderIO, IndustrialCraft2, or Thermal Expansion are considered classical machines. Qrono also includes some classical machines like those used for cooling down the Quantum Network. Quantizer Machines are able to quantize waves into their classical particle-form that can be used by classical machines.  Dequantizer Machines convert classical items, liquids, and power into their wave-form that can be used by the Quantum Network.  In order for this conversion to happen however, the wavefunction of the Quantum Network needs to be collapsed and it will stop processing for the duration of the conversion.  This causes the temperature of machines in the network to increase and will need to be cooled again to superconducting temperatures before it can be started up again.

### World Ore Gen

#### Chronoton Ore

Chronoton is a core component of many components in Qrono.  It's use allows Quantum Machines to operate independently of the outside world.  Chronoton Ore is about as rare as gold and diamonds combined.  

#### Rare Metals and Ceramics

Rare metals, their alloys, and ceramics are used in the superconducting components of Quantum Machines and waveguide conduit.  The base tiers of rare metals are somewhat common in the world.  Mid-tier rare metals are more rare than diamond.  Top-tier metals are ultra-rare and might only be found with a Qrono Quarry or in another dimension.  Superconducting components are required for the Quantum Network to achieve coherence.  Higher-tier components allow for lower cooling requirements.  Different machines require different tiers of superconductors in their construction.

Progression
-----------

Qrono's mechanics are intended to be useable in all tiers of tech and automation.  

### First Steps

The first tier of Qrono provides some basic Quantum Machines and their use independent of other Quantum Machines.  This tier of machines provides basic ore processing and doubling as well as machines necessary to advance to the next tier.

### Getting Connected

The second tier of Qrono uses the first tier machines to build better cooling systems as well as waveguide conduits for connecting multiple machines.  A complete ore processing pipeline with autocrafting is possible in this tier.  Making your first Quantum Network will help significantly in advancing to the next tier by building a Qrono Quarry.

### More Resources!

With the third tier you have the Qrono Quarry.  This tier is focused on mining ores, processing them, refining them, and crafting components for network upgrades.  One important machine available in this tier allows for spooky action at a distance...connect parts of a Quantum Network wirelessly and even across dimensions with **Entangled Waveguides**.  Using these new Entangled Waveguides Qrono Quarries can be setup in other dimensions in order to access ultra-rare ores.

### All the things!!!

The fourth tier allows for essentially unlimited ores and processing capabilities.
